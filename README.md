# Dashboard Description: SpaceX Launch Records Dashboard
The SpaceX Launch Records Dashboard is an interactive analytical tool developed using Plotly Dash to visualize and explore SpaceX’s historical launch data. The dashboard allows users to gain insights into launch success patterns across different launch sites, payload masses, and booster versions.

# Key Features:
Launch Site Dropdown Filter:

Enables users to select individual launch sites or view data across all sites.

Dynamically updates the visualizations based on the selected site.

# Pie Chart – Launch Outcome Distribution:

Displays the proportion of successful and failed launches.

If a specific site is selected, the chart shows success vs. failure for that site.

If “All Sites” is selected, it presents total successful launches per site.

# Payload Mass Range Slider:

Allows interactive filtering of launches based on payload mass (kg).

Helps identify how payload size relates to launch success.

Scatter Plot – Payload vs. Launch Success:

Plots payload mass against launch outcome.

Color-coded by booster version category.

Provides insight into how booster versions and payload mass affect mission outcomes.

# Purpose:
The dashboard is designed to support data-driven decision-making for stakeholders, researchers, and enthusiasts by making SpaceX launch performance data accessible and visually intuitive.
